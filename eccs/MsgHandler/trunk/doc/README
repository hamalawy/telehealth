Requirements:
1) procmail (http://www.procmail.org/)
   (recommended rc file contents):
    :0 f
    *
    {
    	:0c
    	<folder to place email messages -- for easier retrieval>
		
    	:0
    	| <MHPATH>/bin/emailevent $MAILDIR/$LASTFOLDER
	}

2) smstools (http://smstools.meinemullemaus.de/)
   (recommended smsevent file contents):
	...
	if [ "$1" = "RECEIVED" ]; then
		...
		<MHPATH>/bin/smsevent $2
	fi
	...

###
Using the program*:
1) initialization
    cd MHPATH/bin (where init_sc is located)
    chmod 755 init_sc
    ./init_sc

2) add configuration
    vim MHPATH/main/config/main.conf (then modify values)

* note - MHPATH is the path to the root directory where the application is located (higher level than bin, doc, main, modules, etc)

###
Known Issues:
1) MsgHandler [shell] scripts are tested only on Unix environments

2) To update WSDL (web service connection error)
    cd <path to>/MsgHandler/trunk/python
    wsdl2py --complexType <url_address or file_path>

3) Solution to the "/usr/bin/python^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory" problem...
    vim -b <filename>
    :1,$s/^M//g
    :wq
