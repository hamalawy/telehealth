Configurations for MsgHandler:
1) smstools

	if [ "$1" = "RECEIVED" ]; then
		...
		<MHPATH>/bin/smsevent $2
	fi
	...

2) procmail
   (recommended rc file contents):

    *
    {
    	:0c
    	<folder to place email messages -- for easier retrieval>

	}

###
Known Issues:
1) MsgHandler [shell] scripts are tested only on Unix environments

2) To update WSDL (web service connection error)
    cd <path to>/MsgHandler/trunk/python
    wsdl2py --complexType <url_address or file_path>

3) Solution to the "/usr/bin/python^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory" problem...
    vim -b <filename>
    :1,$s/^M//g
    :wq
