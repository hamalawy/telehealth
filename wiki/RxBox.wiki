= Introduction =

A portable medical diagnostic device containing biomedical sensors to measure vital physiological signals linked to a remote dynamic patient database situated in the call station (National Telehealth Center).

----

= RxBox v2.0 Specifications =

The RxBox v2.0 is a device that monitors the health status of the patient in a remote location.
Using medical-grade biomedical modules, it measures the ECG, the pulse rate, the blood
pressure, and the blood-oxygen saturation(%Sp02).

The health data are viewed locally in a GUI, stored in the local computer, and transmitted
to the doctor's workstation in real-time for viewing and analysis. The RxBox is designed to follow medical data standards like the EDF (European Data Format) for time-series data. The RxBox has the following features for telemedicine facility:
    ## EDF file generation
    ## Video-conferencing,
    ## Instant messaging,
    ## Session recording, and
    ## Photo snapshot.

  * Other Features:
    * Use of open-source software;
    * Usability assessment by a human factors expert and by doctors and end-users

  * Physical Specs:
    * Dimensions: 72cm x 47cm x 26 cm (length x width x height),
    * Weight ≈ 20.5 kg.
